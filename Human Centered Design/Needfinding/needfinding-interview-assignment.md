# Human Centered Design: Needfinding

## **Interviewing People to Find Latent Needs**  Assignment

You’ve learned about interviewing and needfinding, now it’s your turn to give it a whirl. Good design often benefits from understanding people. What are the goals, problems, and contexts of the people who might use your design? How might their settings and goals inspire you to create new applications, products, and services? In this assignment, you’ll first create an interview guide. Then it’s showtime: Find a participant, and interview them using your guide. Finally, write a short reflection about your experience and what you learned about interviewing participants to find design opportunities. Remember that at this stage in the design process, your goal is to understand the user’s goals and context. We’re not yet at the stage where we’re looking for feedback on a specific design idea.

The setting for this general area is transportation. You want to learn how people get around. What opportunities can you unearth for redesigning the transportation experience? Your interviewee can be anyone you like: it could be a person on the street, or if you’re feeling shy, it could be a friend or family member.

[Here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/human-computer-interaction/supplement/oFCEG/example-interview-guide) is an example field guide that Google Researcher Dan Russell created for his class at UC San Diego. [Here](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/app/uploads/2014/10/Portigal-Consulting_Reading-Ahead_Interview_Guide.pdf?680497) is another example from Steve Portigal’s excellent book, [Interviewing Users](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/interviewing-users/).

#### Intro Script (2 min)

Thank you for participating!

I'll not be evaluating you in any way, but learning from you about how you transit to places, what works, and doesn't work for you. With this, I hope to glean on ways in which the transportation experience can be improved for people like you. There are no right or wrong answers to any of the questions I'll be asking in this study. I'm simply interested in understanding your choices for different occasions. I will conduct this study mostly as a light discussion on various scenarios and ask questions to better understand what you would do in such circumstances. It would be best if you could give a running commentary of what's going on in your mind. You can talk about things you like or don't like about transportation. Feel free to say anything that comes to your mind.

I will record an audio clip of you so that I can go back and review things later and make sure we get everything right. Your name won't be used in connection with the recordings or the results. The audio files will only be used for peer-review and the spoken things you don't want to be shared will be censored at your behest before being opened to the public.

How does all that sound to you? Do you have any things to clarify at this point?
