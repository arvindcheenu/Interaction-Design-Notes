# Human Centered Design: Needfinding

## Participant Observation

An effective starting point for designing new technology is to clearly identify an existing problem or user need.

Observing people can also help you build empathy and think from their point of view, walk in someone else's shoes or maybe where someone else's gloves.

#### Hallmark Research on Participant Observation

In 1914, **Bronislaw Malinowski** traveled to the Trobriand Islands in Papua New Guinea. While he's there, World War I breaks out, and he has two options. He can either stay on the islands or he faces internment. He was an Austrian citizen. I think you can guess which option he picked. During this period, he developed the practices of participant observation which remain a hallmark ethnographic research to this day.

Referred to by **Ms. Geneive Bell** as **Deep Hanging Out** - By spending time with people doing what they do, doing their work, living their lives, you can get beyond the surface things that people might say in a focus group to learn about what they actually do and care about.

> 💡 Seating Next to an expert, you can **learn a lot**!

* Set up a Partnership
* Learn the steps in the Process
* Observe Practices
* Validate your knowledge as you proceed.

#### Questions to be Answered

- What do people do now? 
- What values and goals do they have? 
- How are the particular things that you're observing embedded in a larger ecology of artifacts and social networks and broader career and personal and professional goals? 
- And what are some similarities and differences across people? 
- Do you see everybody in a particular community doing the same thing or are there some things that are more idiosyncratic?

> 💡 ...one of the **best strategies** for design **observation** and **intervention** is to **look for workarounds and hacks.**

#### Walmart : Lessons Against Leading Questions

Walmart asked people in focus groups **whether they would like the isles to be less cluttered**. With a leading question like that, the kind that you'll know better than to ask, many people said, "Yeah, we would love it if the Walmart stores were less cluttered". So, Walmart spent hundreds of millions of dollars decluttering their stores, they called 15 percent of the inventory, and what happened was actually **sales went down**.

> 🧨 It's simply to point out that **if you ask people what they want as opposed to observing what they do**, you can easily be **led astray**.

## Interviewing

#### Choosing Participants

* Representative of Target Users
* Current Users of a Similar System
* Non-Users
